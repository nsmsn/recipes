# Shrimp Bahn Mi Wrap
Street-food style lunch, inspired by a similar dish at the Heard Museum Cafe, Phoenix AZ. First attempted in 2013.

## Ingredients

1 large carrot, peeled and shredded

2 tbsp rice vinegar

1/2 cup chopped fresh cilantro

3 tbsp low-fat mayonnaise

3 tbsp low-fat plain yogurt

1 tbsp lime juice

1/2 tsp cayenne pepper

1 English cucumber sliced thin

4 scallions, sliced thin lengthwise in 2 inch pieces

8-10 Trader Joe's Habenero Lime tortillas (or similar flavored flour tortilla wrap)

1 lb frozen popcorn shrimp

-- or --

1 pound peeled cooked shrimp(tails removed), fried in Panko breadcrumbs

## Directions
1. Marinate carrot in vinegar, set aside while prepping the rest of the ingredients.

2. Combine cilantro, mayonnaise, yogurt, lime juice and cayenne in a medium bowl. Spread a spoonful of this sauce on each tortilla. 

3. Divide marinated carrot over each wrap, using a fork or slotted spoon. Discard remaining vinegar.

4. Top with shrimp, more sauce, cucumber and scallions
